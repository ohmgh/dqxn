## Decisions

Key decisions accumulated during architecture phase — full table in `DECISIONS.md` (88 entries). Highlights:

- **Per-profile dashboards** over per-widget visibility (sparse layouts, gesture mismatch)
- **Unbounded canvas** with no-straddle snap and no automatic relocation
- **Driving mode deferred** post-launch — DQXN is general-purpose, not vehicle-first
- **Essentials pack** renamed from "free" (packId=`essentials`, entitlement tier stays `free`)
- **Phase 10 decomposed** from original "Features + Polish" into 4 phases (10-13) for settings, theme UI, CI, and E2E

## Context

- All architecture docs finalized under `.planning/`: ARCHITECTURE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, DECISIONS.md, ROADMAP.md, MIGRATION.md (split into per-phase files)
- Old codebase mapped in `.planning/oldcodebase/` (8 docs, ~6000 lines)
- Replication advisory at `.planning/migration/replication-advisory.md` — 7 hard-to-replicate UX areas cross-referenced in phase files and risk-flags.md
- No code written yet — greenfield
