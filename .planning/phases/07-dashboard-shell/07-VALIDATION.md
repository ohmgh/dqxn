# Phase 7 — Validation Strategy

> Generated by `gsd-phase-researcher` during `/gsd:plan-phase 7`.
> Updated by `gsd-plan-checker` after plan approval.
> Governs feedback sampling during `/gsd:execute-phase 7`.

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | JUnit5 + MockK + Truth (unit), Turbine + StandardTestDispatcher (flows) |
| **Config file** | `android/build-logic/convention/src/main/kotlin/dqxn.android.feature.gradle.kts` |
| **Quick run command** | `./gradlew :feature:dashboard:testDebugUnitTest --console=plain` |
| **Full suite command** | `./gradlew test --console=plain` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~30 seconds (dashboard module only) |
| **CI pipeline** | needs creation |

---

## Nyquist Sampling Rate

> The minimum feedback frequency required to reliably catch errors in this phase.

- **After every task commit:** Run `./gradlew :feature:dashboard:testDebugUnitTest --console=plain`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `./gradlew test --console=plain`
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Maximum acceptable task feedback latency:** 30 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| *Populated after planning* | | | | | | | |

*Status values: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

> Test scaffolding committed BEFORE any implementation task. Executor runs Wave 0 first.

- [ ] `DashboardTestHarness` DSL — shared test infrastructure for coordinator integration
- [ ] Contract test stubs for 6 coordinators
- [ ] `HarnessStateOnFailure` JUnit5 TestWatcher for auto-dumping state on failure

*Detailed file list populated by planner.*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

> Behaviors that genuinely cannot be automated, with justification.
> These are surfaced during `/gsd:verify-work` UAT.

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| 60fps grid rendering with 12+ widgets | NF1 | Physical device frame profiling | Deploy to device, add 12 widgets, observe frame histogram via `get-metrics` |
| Foldable viewport behavior | NF46 | Requires foldable device or emulator | Test fold/unfold transitions, verify no-straddle snap |
| Reduced motion transitions | NF39 | Requires system setting change | Set `animator_duration_scale=0`, verify instant transitions |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

Updated by `gsd-plan-checker` when plans are approved:

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify commands or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] No 3 consecutive implementation tasks without automated verify (sampling continuity)
- [ ] Wave 0 test files cover all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags in any automated command
- [ ] Feedback latency per task: < 30s ✅
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Plan-checker approval:** pending

## Execution Tracking

Updated during `/gsd:execute-phase 7`:

| Wave | Tasks | Tests Run | Pass | Fail | Sampling Status |
|------|-------|-----------|------|------|-----------------|
| 0 | TBD | — | — | — | scaffold |
| 1 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ⬜ pending |
| 2 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ⬜ pending |

**Phase validation complete:** pending
